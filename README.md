# 🛒 Shopping Database with Views in SQL

This project demonstrates the use of SQL to:

- Create a **Shopping** database and table.
- Insert sample data.
- Create and use **Views** for abstraction and security.

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Create the Database and Table

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Shopping;

CREATE TABLE Shopping (
    ItemID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ItemName VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2),
    Quantity INT
);
````

---

## 📝 Step 2: Insert Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO Shopping VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 'Electronics', 65000.00, 5),
(2, 'Smartphone', 'Electronics', 25000.00, 10),
(3, 'Jeans', 'Clothing', 1500.00, 20),
(4, 'Shoes', 'Footwear', 2000.00, 15),
(5, 'Watch', 'Accessories', 3000.00, 8);
```

---

## 👁️ Step 3: Create Views

### a) `ElectronicsInventory` View

This view returns only Electronics items and their total inventory value (Price × Quantity).

```sql
CREATE VIEW ElectronicsInventory AS
SELECT 
    ItemID,
    ItemName,
    Price,
    Quantity,
    (Price * Quantity) AS TotalValue
FROM 
    Shopping
WHERE 
    Category = 'Electronics';
```

#### ✅ Usage:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ElectronicsInventory;
```

---

### b) `CustomerView` View

This view hides price and quantity. It is useful for customers who only need to see item name and category.

```sql
CREATE VIEW CustomerView AS
SELECT 
    ItemName,
    Category
FROM 
    Shopping;
```

#### ✅ Usage:

```sql
SELECT * FROM CustomerView;
```

## 🔐 Benefits of Using Views

| Feature     | Benefit                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Abstraction | Hides complexity by simplifying queries                                  |
| Security    | Restricts access to sensitive columns like price and quantity            |
| Reusability | Allows the same complex query logic to be reused easily                  |
| Maintenance | Changes to the base table don’t require modifying dependent applications |
